- [error: database connect timeout](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35880022/error-connect-etimedout-rds-lambda)
  
  **resolution**: In the security attached to the RDS instance, modify an inbound rule for mysql/aurora (port 3306) and rather than adding it for an IP address add it for your lambda functions security group.
- [error: S3 read-only file system](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53810516/getting-error-aws-lambda-erofs-read-only-file-system-open-var-task-assets)

  **resolution**: save temporary file to /tmp folder in lambda.
